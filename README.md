Allows you to create domains that seem as if they are impossible.


--1.sh--

Pros: Stable, short code

Cons: No admin port (80)



--2.sh--

Pros: Admin port

Cons: Unstable



## What is the port 80? ##
Port 80 does not show on these "URLS" so it looks more realistic.
Ex: spaceships.tech:3391 vs spaceships.tech


-----------------------------------------
Notes: 

I've never really tested these as .sh files. Just simply paste it into terminal

1.sh AND 2.sh both require an admin password. The sole difference is the availability of the admin port and the stability/error count.
